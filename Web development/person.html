    <p>Patrick Mahomes is an American football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League. 
    The son of former Major League Baseball pitcher Pat Mahomes, he played college football and baseball at Texas Tech.
    Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football.
    In his junior year, he led all NCAA Division I FBS players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052) and total touchdowns (53).
    He was selected 10th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL Draft.
    He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL.</p>
    <p> Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith.
    He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins (another NFL team).
    That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. 
    He joined Peyton Manning as the only players in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 passing touchdowns in the same season. 
    For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl,
    named first-team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. 
    Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.</p>
